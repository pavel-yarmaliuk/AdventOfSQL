# Task 22

The penguins are signing up for a community sleigh ride, but the organizers need a list of everyone who did NOT choose the "Evening Ride." How would you return all penguins whose selected time is not the evening slot?

Sample data:

**sleigh_ride_signups(signup_id: INT, penguin_name: VARCHAR, ride_time: VARCHAR)**
