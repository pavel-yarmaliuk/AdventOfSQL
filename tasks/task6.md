# Task 6

Buddy is planning a winter getaway and wants to rank ski resorts by annual snowfall. Can you help him bucket these ski resorts into quartiles?

Sample data:

**resort_monthly_snowfall(resort_id, resort_name, snow_month, snowfall_inches)**

| resort_id | snow_month | resort_name     | snowfall_inches |
