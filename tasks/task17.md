# Task 17

During a quiet evening of reflection, Cindy Lou wants to categorize her tasks based on how peaceful they are. Can you write a query that adds a new column classifying each task as 'Calm' if its noise_level is below 50, and 'Chaotic' otherwise?

Sample data:

**evening_tasks(task_id: INTEGER, task_name: VARCHAR, noise_level: INTEGER)**

| task_id | task_name            | noise_level |
